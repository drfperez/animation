Sant Jordi legend animations using Pivot Animator v. 5 (stk files and background)

You will find Pivot Animator v.5 portable ready to run in your pendrive and files to perform the animation (dragons, fire, princes, princesses, swords, comic text bubbles, backgrounds and the like). More figures to be used available at https://pivotanimator.net/stk-library/

You may notice if you want to use Pivot Animator from the official site you need not to click Next before reading because unwanted bloatware can be installed.
